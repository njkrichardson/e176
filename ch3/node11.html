Issues of Local/Global Minimum</A>
</H2>

<P>
A main concern in optimization problems is whether the solution obtained by 
the algorithm is a local minimum or a global one. The simulated annealing
(SA) algorithm is typically used to search for the global minimum in a 
high-dimensional space, by allowing up-hill moves in the iteration to avoid
getting stuck by a local minimum. SA mimics the annealing process in metallurgy,
in which the temperature is carefully controlled to decrease slowly so that the
material reaches a state with minimum free energy. 

<P>
The way the SA method avoids getting stuck at a local minimum is to allow the 
iteration steps to go up-hill. Specifically, the objective function <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math758#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline19931#</SPAN> 
evaluated at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline19933#</SPAN> is treated as the energy at <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline19935#</SPAN>, and an up-hill 
move corresponding to an energy increase <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math759#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline19937#</SPAN> 
can be accepted if some probability function is greater than a random threshold 
value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline19939#</SPAN> within a certain range comparable with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline19941#</SPAN>:

Obviously smaller <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline19945#</SPAN> and higher <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline19947#</SPAN> will cause higher <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline19949#</SPAN>, it is more
probable for a move to be accepted.

<P>
During the entire search process, the temperature <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline19951#</SPAN> gradually reduces so that 
the probability of accepting an up-hill move also gradually reduces. In the early
stage of the search, it is more probable to go up-hill, thereby getting out of a
local minimum; but toward the later part of the search process, such a move is
less likely to happen, as presumably in this late stage of the search, the energy
level is already low, not likely to be at a local minimum with high energy level.
Through out the search, the best result corresponding to he lowest energy level
is always updated, to be returned as the final solution at the end of the process.
