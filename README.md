# Machine Learning

Engineering 176 is a upper-division engineering elective taught by Professor Ruye Wang at Harvey Mudd College. Machine learning in its broadest definition concerns the automatic discovery of structure from data. It emerged as a confluence of computational statistics, optimization, information theory, and statistical physics (to name a few). In modern times, machine learning has developed into a serious intellectual domain in its own right, pushing the frontier of how we apply math to complex problems. In this sense, machine learning becomes increasingly specialized, as researchers stake out their own corner of the landscape. This course intends to provide engineers with the theoretical foundation, and practical confidence to begin applying machine learning to their own problems. Key topics include linear regression, kernel machines, gaussian processes, neural networks, and manifold learning.

Another goal of this course is to become comfortable using GitHub and Jupyter Lab, as these tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in industry and academia when developing and deploying models. To that end, for each model described in an academic context, we provide demos in the form of fully functional jupyter notebooks, which instantiate the algorithms both from numpy, and then again using popular libraries.
